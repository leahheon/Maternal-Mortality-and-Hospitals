Introduction: 

Maternal mortality is a persistent health concern in the United States, particularly in areas with fewer hospitals. Distance to medical facilties plays a role in the prevalence of maternal deaths; therefore, I analyzed the potential relationship between distance to the nearest hospital and mortality rates. To inform my analysis, I mapped the nearest distance from county centroids to a level 1 trauma center, which is the most comprehensive unit of care.
